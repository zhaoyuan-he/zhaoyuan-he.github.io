I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). I am very honored to be advised by [Prof. Lili Qiu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lili/). I am also affiliated with the [Wireless Networking & Communications Group](https://wncg.org/) (WNCG). My research interests span areas of wireless networking, mobile computing, and machine learning systems, with emphasis on the use of AI/ML approaches for Internet video delivery. I also have a broad interest in efficient/tiny ML and its applications on resource-constrained devices.

Before joining UT-Austin, I obtained my M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of California San Diego in 2019, where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Xinyu Zhang](http://xyzhang.ucsd.edu/). Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree in Electronic Information Engineering from Beihang University (former BUAA) in 2017.

Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my experience and research.
