I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Austin. I am very honored to be advised by [Prof. Lili Qiu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lili/). My research interests span areas of wireless networking, mobile computing, and machine learning systems, with emphasis on the use of AI/ML approaches for Internet video delivery. Before joining UT-Austin, I obtained my M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of California San Diego in 2019, where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Xinyu Zhang](http://xyzhang.ucsd.edu/). Prior to that, I received my B.S. degree in Electronic Information Engineering from Beihang University (former BUAA) in 2017.
